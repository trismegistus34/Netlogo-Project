# Netlogo-Project
University project in Netlogo modeling the basic behavior of passengers in a train. Made in collaboration with @bodoz

Allows user to simulate passengers passing through a train car, where they will take a seat on any available seats in their vicinity, or else pass through the car and eventually come back. The passengers will occupy their seats for a given period of time, then they will leave the train, allowing others to take their seats. The program shows how long it takes for every passenger to have taken a seat, given a certain amout of passengers and an average time spent sitting.
